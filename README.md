## Importing libraries
### Tkinter
Import the module - "tkinter"</br>
#### Front end
* Create a window win = Tk()</br>
> |--win = Tk() <br/>
* Create window geometry
> |--win.geometry('n*m') <br/> 
 
* Create window title 
> |--win.title('title name')  <br/>
* Set the background colour
> |--win.configure(bg='colour') <br/>
* Create labels for the window
* Create buttons for the result 
* Create the listbox to display the result on the window.
* Create the windowed main loop
> |--win.mainloop() <br/>
   
   ## Math operations
   Define the functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulus , division, HCF and other mathematical operations and return the values.
   
   ## Operations list
   Define a dictionary  which contains all the similar words related to the operations like for addition  (plus, add, sum)  and for modulus  (mod, remainder, modulus) these kind of words
   
   ## Calculation
   Define two functions one to extract the numbers from the main one second to use the numbers to make he sum or difference according to the operator present.
   > |def extract_from_text(text): <br/>
   > |def calculate(): <br/>
   use for, if-elif, try-except conditionals for the logic of the function to execute.
